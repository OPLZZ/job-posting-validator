== job-posting-validator

This is a validator and preview for structured data (both {RDFa}[http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-in-html/] and {Microdata}[http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html]) described using {Schema.org}[http://schema.org] {JobPosting}[http://schema.org/JobPosting].

=== Usage

* If you don't have {Fuseki server}[http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/index.html] installed, you can install it by running <tt>bundle exec rake validator:fuseki:install</tt>. By default this will install Fuseki Server version 1.0.1. You can ask for different version using the <tt>$FUSEKI_VERSION</tt> environment variable (e.g., <tt>export FUSEKI_VERSION=1.2.3</tt>).
* If you haven't previously downloaded background data (including Schema.org) needed for the validator, run <tt>bundle exec rake validator:data:import_background_data</tt>.
* Run <tt>bundle exec rake validator:fuseki:init</tt> to start the database (Fuseki Server) and load background data.
* Deploy the Rails app.
* Other useful Rake tasks (run <tt>bundle exec rake -T validator</tt> to list the available tasks):
  * <tt>bundle exec rake validator:fuseki:stop</tt> to stop the Fuseki server.
